info about decoding / encoding trees


Header:

5 bits -> number of tree codes - 257
5 bits -> numner of distance codes - 1
4 bits -> number of codes in codelength tree - 4

Info for code length tree:

19 values in code length alphabet

0-15 -> code length values
16 -> repeat last code length 3 - 6 times
    2 bits + 3
17 -> repeast 0 3-10 times
    3 bits + 3
18 -> repeat 0 11-138 times
    7 bits + 11

Code Length Tree Encoding:

3 bits * nCodesInTree -> tree data

Encode next to trees with the above tree starting with the main tree and then the distance tree
    * for the distnace if there are no distances just create a 1 node tree to replace it's spot incase having no tree causes errors somewhere
